Most businesses are required to submit VAT returns online either via HMRC's business tax account or via third-party software to complying with Making Tax Digital requirements.<br/><br/>\nb. Those who qualify for an exemption from filing online must file their paper-based returns within 1 calendar month of an accounting period.<br/><br/>\nc. Where there is a part-year of less than 4 months, an entity will only be permitted a month to submit their return and balancing payment.</p>\n           </div>\n        </div>\n        <br/>\n        <div className='container'>\n            <div>\n            <h4>VAT - Payment</h4>\n            <p>Payment of VAT associated with a monthly/quarterly return.<br/><br/>\nThe payment deadline for returns submitted electronically is 1 calendar month and 7 days from the end of an VAT accounting period.<br/><br/>\nWhere payment is made by Direct Debit, HMRC will normally collect the amount due 3 workings days after the return filing deadline.<br/><br/>\nNote:<br/><br/>\nDifferent rules apply for those who account for their VAT under the Annual Accounting Scheme.</p>\n        </div>\n        </div>\n    \n    <br/>\n    <div className='container'>\n        <div>\n            <h4>Disclaimer</h4>\n            <p>Please note that you should not take any action based on these tax dates, they are for advisory purposes only.<br/><br/>\nYou should consult with us before making any decisions so that we can advise you on the best course of action.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n</>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Vta;","import React from 'react';\nimport { Link} from \"react-router-dom\";\n\n\n\nconst Menu=() => {\n  return (\n   <>\n  \n   \n     \n          <div className='con'>\n             <div >\n               \n              <Link to=\"/keytaxdate\" className='Link'><div>Capital Grains Tax Filing and Payment Deadlines Filing Date</div></Link>\n              <hr/>\n              <Link to=\"/cg\" className='Link' ><div>Corporation Tax & Companies House Statutory Filing Dates</div></Link>\n              <hr/>\n              <Link to=\"/It\" className='Link'><div>Inocme Tax Self-Assessment Filing and Payment Deadlines</div> </Link>\n              <hr/>\n              <Link to=\"/Pas\" className='Link'><div>Pay as You Earn (PAYE) and Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) Filing and Payment Deadlines</div> </Link>\n              <hr/>\n              <Link to=\"/Vat\" className='Link'><div>VAT Filing and Payment Deadlines</div></Link>\n              <hr/>\n            </div>        \n          \n          </div> \n   </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Menu;\n","import React from 'react';\n\nconst Error=() => {\n  return (\n   <>\n   <h1>opps! just a demo Page not found</h1>\n\n   </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Error;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport {Route, Switch} from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport Keytaxdate from \"./Keytaxdate\";\nimport Cg from \"./Cg\";\nimport It from \"./It\";\nimport Pas from \"./Pas\";\nimport Vat from \"./vta\";\nimport Menu from \"./Menu\";\nimport Error from \"./Error\";\n  \n\nconst App = () => {\n  return (\n    <> \n     \n      <Switch>\n        <Route exact path='/TaxAssistantWeb' component={Menu} />\n        <Route path='/keytaxdate' component={Keytaxdate} />\n        <Route path='/cg' component={Cg}/>\n        <Route path='/It' component={It}/>\n        <Route path='/Pas' component={Pas}/>\n        <Route path='/Vat' component={Vat}/>\n        <Route path='/Error'component={Error}/>\n      </Switch>\n \n   </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\n\n\nReactDOM.render(\n    <BrowserRouter>\n      <App />\n    </BrowserRouter>,\n\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
