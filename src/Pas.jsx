            <h4>PAYE - Submission Deadlines</h4>
            <h4>31st May</h4>
            <p>Last date to issue the P60 to those employed on the immediately preceding 5th April.<br/><br/>
A P60 is the summary of an employee's total pay and deductions for a given tax year.</p>
            <h4>6th July</h4>
            <p>Last date for agreeing to the PAYE settlement agreement (PSA) for the preceding tax year.<br/><br/>
PAYE Settlement Agreement (PSA) allows an employer to make one annual payment to cover all the tax and National Insurance due on minor, irregular or impracticable expenses or benefits paid or provided for employees.<br/><br/>
A PSA means that for these items an employer won't need to put them through a payroll to work out tax and National Insurance, report them in end-of-year P11D forms or pay Class 1A National Insurance on them at the end of the tax year. Instead, an employer pays Class 1B National Insurance as part of your PSA instead.<br/><br/>
Some employee expenses are covered by exemptions (which have replaced dispensations). This means you won't have to include them in your end-of-year reports.

<h4>6th July</h4>
a. Deadline for filing expenses and benefits forms P9D, P11D, P11D(b) relating to the preceding tax year.<br/><br/>
b. Last date to issue P9D and P11D to relevant employees.</p>

a. An Employer Payment Summary (EPS) to report either no payment being due or amounts being recovered from payment.<br/><br/>
The EPS should be sent prior to making payments for the related month.<br/><br/>
b. Online CIS monthly returns, detailing payment to contractors made on or before the 5th of the month.<br/><br/>
Where a return is nil, HMRC should be advised over the phone.</p>
