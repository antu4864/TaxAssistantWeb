            <h3>Returns relating to disposals of UK land - Submission Deadlines</h3>
              <p>Since April 2020 any UK resident disposing of a UK residential property who has CGT to pay, has to calculate, report and pay the tax within 30 days of completion. The report must be made online via the UK Property Reporting Service.<br></br><br></br>
                Note:<br></br><br></br>
                Since April 2015, non-resident individuals are also liable to CGT on disposals of UK land or property.

          <div>If you have other capital gains to report<br></br><br></br>
               If the capital gains are not from residential property sold in the UK since 6 April 2020, there are choices as to how and when to report the tax.<br></br><br></br>
               <h4>Real-time reporting</h4>
               A taxpayer may use the 'real time' Capital Gains Tax service immediately if you know what you owe.<br></br><br></br>
               Where it is intended to use the real time service, the gain must be reported by 31 December following the tax year in which the gain was made.<br></br><br></br>
               Following the use of the real time reporting service, HMRC will send a letter or email telling detailing when and how to pay.<br></br><br></br>
               <h4>Report gains via Self Assessment</h4>
               <p>Taxpayers may also report their gains and pay the CGT due under Self Assessment in the tax year after the disposal was made.</p>
